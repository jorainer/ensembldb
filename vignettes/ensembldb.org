* How to export this to a =Rnw= vignette			   :noexport:

Use =ox-ravel= from the =orgmode-accessories= package to export this file to a =Rnw= file. After export edit the generated =Rnw= in the following way:

1) Delete all =\usepackage= commands.
2) Move the =<<style>>= code chunk before the =\begin{document}= and before =\author=.
3) Move all =%\Vignette...= lines at the start of the file (even before =\documentclass=).
4) Replace =\date= with =\date{Modified: 21 October, 2013. Compiled: \today}=
5) Eventually search for all problems with =texttt=, i.e. search for pattern ="==.

Note: use =:ravel= followed by the properties for the code chunk headers, e.g. =:ravel results='hide'=. Other options for knitr style options are:
+ =results=: ='hide'= (hides all output, not warnings or messages), ='asis'=, ='markup'= (the default).
+ =warning=: =TRUE= or =FALSE= whether warnings should be displayed.
+ =message=: =TRUE= or =FALSE=, same as above.
+ =include=: =TRUE= or =FALSE=, whether the output should be included into the final document (code is still evaluated).

* Introduction

The =ensembldb= package provides functions to create and use transcript centric annotation databases/packages. The annotation for the databases are directly fetched from Ensembl [fn:1] using their Perl API.
The functionality and data is similar to that of the =TxDb= packages from the =GenomicFeatures= package, but, in addition to retrieve all gene/transcript models and annotations from the database, the =ensembldb= package provides also a filter framework allowing to retrieve annotations for specific entries like genes encoded on a chromosome region or transcript models of lincRNA genes.
In the databases, along with the gene and transcript models and their chromosomal coordinates, additional annotations including the gene name (symbol) and NCBI Entrezgene identifiers as well as the gene and transcript biotypes are stored too (see Section [[section.database.layout]] for the database layout and an overview of available attributes/columns).

Another main goal of this package is to generate /versioned/ annotation packages, i.e. annotation packages that are build for a specific Ensembl release, and are also named according to that (e.g. =EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75= for human gene definitions of the Ensembl code database version 75). This ensures reproducibility, as it allows to load annotations from a specific Ensembl release also if newer versions of annotation packages/releases are available. It also allows to load multiple annotation packages at the same time in order to e.g. compare gene models between Ensembl releases.

In the example below we load an Ensembl based annotation package for Homo sapiens, Ensembl version 75. The connection to the database is bound to the variable =EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel warning=FALSE, message=FALSE
  library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)

  ## print some informations for this package
  EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75

  ## for what organism was the database generated?
  organism(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)
#+END_SRC


* Using =ensembldb= annotation packages to retrieve specific annotations

The =ensembldb= package provides a set of filter objects allowing to specify which entries should be fetched from the database. The complete list of filters, which can be used individually or can be combined, is shown below (in alphabetical order):

+ =ExonidFilter=: allows to filter the result based on the (Ensembl) exon identifiers.
+ =EntrezidFilter=: allows to filter results based on NCBI Entrezgene identifiers of the genes.
+ =GenebiotypeFilter=: allows to filter for the gene biotypes defined in the Ensembl database; use the =listGenebiotypes= method to list all available biotypes.
+ =GeneidFilter=: allows to filter based on the Ensembl gene IDs.
+ =GenenameFilter=: allows to filter based on the names (symbols) of the genes.
+ =SeqendFilter=: filter based on the chromosomal end coordinate of the exons, transcripts or genes (correspondingly set =feature="exon"=, =feature="tx"= or =feature="gene"=).
+ =SeqnameFilter=: filter by the name of the chromosomes the genes are encoded on.
+ =SeqstartFilter=: filter based on the chromosomal start coordinates of the exons, transcripts or genes (correspondingly set =feature="exon"=, =feature="tx"= or =feature="gene"=).
+ =SeqstrandFilter=: filter for the chromosome strand on which the genes are encoded.
+ =TxbiotypeFilter=: filter on the transcript biotype defined in Ensembl; use the =listTxbiotypes= method to list all available biotypes.
+ =TxidFilter=: filter on the Ensembl transcript identifiers.

Each of the filter classes can take a single value or a vector of values (with the exception of the =SeqendFilter= and =SeqstartFilter=) for comparison. In addition, it is possible to specify the /condition/ for the filter, e.g. =condition="="= to retrieve all entries matching the filter value, =condition="!="= to negate the filter or also =condition="like"= to allow partial matching. The =condition= parameter for =SeqendFilter= and =SeqendFilter= can take the values ===, =>=, =>==, =<= and =<== (since these filters base on numeric values).

A simple example would be to get all transcripts for the gene /BCL2L11/. To this end we specify a =GenenameFilter= with the value ="BCL2L11"=. As a result we get a =GRanges= object with =start=, =end=, =strand= and =seqname= of the =GRanges= object being the start coordinate, end coordinate, chromosome name and strand for the respective transcripts. All additional annotations are available as metadata columns. Alternatively, by setting =return.type="DataFrame"=, or =return.type="data.frame"= the method would return a =DataFrame= object or =data.frame=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  Tx <- transcripts(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75, filter=list(GenenameFilter("BCL2L11")))

  Tx

  ## as this is a GRanges object we can access e.g. the start coordinates with
  head(start(Tx))

  ## or extract the biotype with
  head(Tx$tx_biotype)
#+END_SRC

The parameter =columns= of the =exons=, =genes= and =transcripts= method allow to specify which database attributes (columns) should be retrieved. Note that these are not restricted to columns of the corresponding database table (e.g. columns of database table /gene/ for =genes=). To get an overview of database tables and available columns the function =listTables= can be used. The method =listColumns= on the other hand lists columns for the specified database table.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## list all database tables along with their columns
  listTables(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)

  ## list columns from a specific table
  listColumns(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75, "tx")
#+END_SRC

Thus, we could retrieve all transcripts of the biotype /nonsense_mediated_decay/ (which, according to the definitions by Ensembl are transcribed, but most likely not translated in a protein, but rather degraded after transcription) along with the name of the gene for each transcript. Note that we are changing here the =return.type= to =DataFrame=, so the method will return a =DataFrame= with the results instead of the default =GRanges=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  Tx <- transcripts(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75,
                    columns=c(listColumns(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75 , "tx"), "gene_name"),
                    filter=list(TxbiotypeFilter("nonsense_mediated_decay")),
                    return.type="DataFrame")
  nrow(Tx)
  Tx
#+END_SRC

To get an overview of allowed/available gene and transcript biotype the functions =listGenebiotypes= and =listTxbiotypes= can be used.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## Get all gene biotypes from the database. The GenebiotypeFilter
  ## allows to filter on these values.
  listGenebiotypes(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)

  ## Get all transcript biotypes from the database.
  listTxbiotypes(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)
#+END_SRC

Data can be fetched in an analogous way using the =exons= and =genes= methods. In the example below we retrieve =gene_name=, =entrezid= and the =gene_biotype= of all genes in the database which names start with ="BCL2"=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## We're going to fetch all genes which names start with BCL. To this end
  ## we define a GenenameFilter with partial matching, i.e. condition "like"
  ## and a % for any character/string.
  BCLs <- genes(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75,
                columns=c("gene_name", "entrezid", "gene_biotype"),
                filter=list(GenenameFilter("BCL%", condition="like")),
                return.type="DataFrame")
  nrow(BCLs)
  BCLs
#+END_SRC

Sometimes it might be useful to know the length of genes or transcripts (i.e. the total sum of nucleotides covered by their exons). Below we calculate the mean length of transcripts from protein coding genes on chromosomes X and Y as well as the average length of snoRNA, snRNA and rRNA transcripts encoded on these chromosomes.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## determine the average length of snRNA, snoRNA and rRNA genes encoded on
  ## chromosomes X and Y.
  mean(lengthOf(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75, of="tx",
                filter=list(GenebiotypeFilter(c("snRNA", "snoRNA", "rRNA")),
                    SeqnameFilter(c("X", "Y")))))

  ## determine the average length of protein coding genes encoded on the same
  ## chromosomes.
  mean(lengthOf(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75, of="tx",
                filter=list(GenebiotypeFilter("protein_coding"),
                    SeqnameFilter(c("X", "Y")))))
#+END_SRC

Not unexpectedly, transcripts of protein coding genes are longer than those of snRNA, snoRNA or rRNA genes.


* Extracting gene/transcript/exon models for RNASeq feature counting

For the feature counting step of an RNAseq experiment, the gene or transcript models (defined by the chromosomal start and end positions of their exons) have to be known. To extract these from an Ensembl based annotation package, the =exonsBy=, =genesBy= and =transcriptsBy= methods can be used in an analogous way as in =TxDb= packages generated by the =GenomicFeatures= package.
However, the =transcriptsBy= method does not, in contrast to the method in the =GenomicFeatures= package, allow to return transcripts by ="cds"=. While the annotation packages built by the =ensembldb= contain the chromosomal start and end coordinates of the coding region (for protein coding genes) they do not assign an ID to each CDS.

A simple use case is to retrieve all genes encoded on chromosomes X and Y from the database.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  TxByGns <- transcriptsBy(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75, by="gene",
                           filter=list(SeqnameFilter(c("X", "Y")))
                           )
  TxByGns
#+END_SRC

Since Ensembl contains also definitions of genes that are on chromosome variants (supercontigs), it is advisable to specify the chromosome names for which the gene models should be returned.

In a real use case, we might thus want to retrieve all genes encoded on the /standard/ chromosomes. In addition it is advisable to use a =GeneidFilter= to restrict to Ensembl genes only, as also /LRG/ (Locus Reference Genomic) genes[fn:3] are defined in the database, which are partially redundant with Ensembl genes.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel eval=FALSE
  ## will just get exons for all genes on chromosomes 1 to 22, X and Y.
  ## Note: want to get rid of the "LRG" genes!!!
  EnsGenes <- exonsBy(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75, by="gene",
                      filter=list(SeqnameFilter(c(1:22, "X", "Y")),
                          GeneidFilter("ENSG%", "like")))
#+END_SRC

The code above returns a =GRangesList= that can be used directly as an input for the =summarizeOverlaps= function from the =GenomicAlignments= package [fn:4].

Alternatively, the above =GRangesList= can be transformed to a =data.frame= in /SAF/ format that can be used as an input to the =featureCounts= function of the =Rsubread= package [fn:5].

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel eval=FALSE
  ## Transforming the GRangesList into a data.frame in SAF format
  EnsGenes.SAF <- toSAF(EnsGenes)

#+END_SRC

Note that the ID by which the =GRangesList= is split is used in the SAF formatted =data.frame= as the =GeneID=. In the example below this would be the Ensembl gene IDs, while the start, end coordinates (along with the strand and chromosomes) are those of the the exons.

In addition, the =disjointExons= function (similar to the one defined in =GenomicFeatures=) can be used to generate a =GRanges= of non-overlapping exon parts which can be used in the =DEXSeq= package.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel eval=FALSE
  ## Create a GRanges of non-overlapping exon parts.
  DJE <- disjointExons(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75,
                       filter=list(SeqnameFilter(c(1:22, "X", "Y")),
                            GeneidFilter("ENSG%", "like")))

#+END_SRC



* Retrieving sequences for gene/transcript/exon models

The methods to retrieve exons, transcripts and genes (i.e. =exons=, =transcripts= and =genes=) return by default =GRanges= objects that can be used to retrieve sequences using the =getSeq= method e.g. from BSgenome packages. The basic workflow is thus identical to the one for =TxDb= packages, however, it is not straight forward to identify the BSgenome package with the matching genomic sequence. Most BSgenome packages are named according to the genome build identifier used in UCSC which does not (always) match the genome build name used by Ensembl.
Using the Ensembl version provided by the =EnsDb=, the correct genomic sequence can however be retrieved easily from the =AnnotationHub= using the =getGenomeFaFile=.

In the code block below we retrieve first the =FaFile= with the genomic DNA sequence, extract the genomic start and end coordinates for all genes defined in the package, subset to genes encoded on sequences available in the =FaFile= and extract all of their sequences.
Note: these sequences represent the sequence between the chromosomal start and end coordinates of the gene.
To retrieve the (exonic) sequence of transcripts (i.e. without introns) we first fetch all exons grouped by transcripts and then extract and paste the sequence of all of the transcripts' exons.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel eval=FALSE
  ## load the AnnotationHub data
  library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)
  library(Rsamtools)
  edb <- EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75

  ## get the FaFile with the genomic sequence matching the Ensembl version
  ## using the AnnotationHub package.
  Dna <- getGenomeFaFile(edb)
  ## get start/end coordinates of all genes
  genes <- genes(edb)
  ## subset to all genes that are encoded on chromosomes for which
  ## we do have DNA sequence available.
  genes <- genes[seqnames(genes) %in% seqnames(seqinfo(Dna))]
  ## get the gene sequences, i.e. the sequence including the sequence of
  ## all of the gene's exons and introns
  geneSeqs <- getSeq(Dna, genes)

  ## to get the sequence of all transcripts (i.e. only their exonic sequence) we
  ## fetch the exons grouped by transcripts.
  ## get all exons by transcript for all genes defined by Ensembl. This excludes
  ## eventual "LRG" genes, that might be encoded on a sequence for which we don't
  ## have a DNA sequence.
  txExons <- exonsBy(edb, "tx", filter=GeneidFilter("ENS%", condition="like"))
  ## extract sequence of all of each transcripts' exons and join them into a single
  ## sequence; this takes quite some time, so we just run it on the first 100.
  txSeqs <- lapply(txExons[1:100], function(x){unlist(getSeq(Dna, x))})

#+END_SRC




* Interactive annotation lookup using the =shiny= web app

In addition to the =genes=, =transcripts= and =exons= methods it is possibly to
search interactively for gene/transcript/exon annotations using the internal,
=shiny= based, web application. The application can be started with the
=runEnsDbApp()= function.

* Important notes

These notes might explain eventually unexpected results (and, more importantly, help avoiding them):

+ The ordering of the results returned by the =genes=, =exons=, =transcripts= methods can be specified with the =order.by= parameter. The ordering of the results does however *not* correspond to the ordering of values in submitted filter objects.

+ Results of =exonsBy=, =transcriptsBy= are always ordered by the =by= argument.


* Building an transcript centric database package based on Ensembl annotation

The code in this section is not supposed to be automatically executed when the vignette is built, as this would require a working installation of the Ensembl Perl API, which is not expected to be available on each system. Also, fetching data from the Ensembl database takes quite some time, thus, in this section only the code is displayed, but not executed.


** Requirements

The =fetchTablesFromEnsembl= function of the package uses the Ensembl Perl API to retrieve the required annotations from an Ensembl database (e.g. from the main site /ensembldb.ensembl.org/). Thus, to use the functionality to built databases, the Ensembl Perl API needs to be installed (see [fn:2] for details).

Alternatively, the =ensDbFromGRanges= and =ensDbFromGtf= functions allow to build EnsDb SQLite files from a =GRanges= object or an Ensembl GTF file and thus doesn't depend on the Ensembl Perl API. Such =GRanges= objects could for example be retrieved with the =AnnotationHub= package.


** Building an annotation package

The functions below use the Ensembl Perl API to fetch the required data directly from the Ensembl core databases. Thus, the path to the Perl API specific for the desired Ensembl version needs to be added to the =PERL5LIB= environment variable.

An annotation package containing all human genes for Ensembl version 75 can be created using the code in the block below.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel eval=FALSE
  library(ensembldb)

  ## get all human gene/transcript/exon annotations from Ensembl (75)
  ## the resulting tables will be stored by default to the current working
  ## directory
  fetchTablesFromEnsembl(75, species="human")

  ## These tables can then be processed to generate a SQLite database
  ## containing the annotations (again, the function assumes the required
  ## txt files to be present in the current working directory)
  DBFile <- makeEnsemblSQLiteFromTables()

  ## and finally we can generate the package
  makeEnsembldbPackage(ensdb=DBFile, version="0.99.12",
                       maintainer="Johannes Rainer <johannes.rainer@eurac.edu>",
                       author="J Rainer")

#+END_SRC

The generated package can then be build using =R CMD build EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75= and installed with =R CMD INSTALL EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75*=.
Note that we could directly generate an =EnsDb= instance by loading the database file, i.e. by calling =edb <- EnsDb(DBFile)= and work with that annotation object.

To fetch and build annotation packages for plant genomes (e.g. arabidopsis thaliana), the /Ensembl genomes/ should be specified as a host, i.e. setting =host = "mysql-eg-publicsql.ebi.ac.uk"=, =port=4157= and species to e.g. =species = "arabidopsis thaliana"=.

In the next example we create an =EnsDb= database using the =AnnotationHub= package and load also the corresponding genomic DNA sequence matching the Ensembl version. We thus first query the =AnnotationHub= package for all resources available for =Mus musculus= and the Ensembl release 77. Next we load the =gtf= file for the transcript definitions and the =dna.toplevel.fa= file for the DNA sequence. From the =GRanges= object representing the =gtf= file we can build and load an =EnsDb=.
At last we retrieve the sequences of all exons using the =getSeq= method.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel eval=FALSE
  ## load the AnnotationHub data
  library(AnnotationHub)
  ah <- AnnotationHub()

  ## query all available files from Ensembl release 77 for
  ## Mus musculus
  query(ah, c("Mus musculus", "release-77"))

  ## get the gtf file
  Gtf <- ah[["AH28822"]]
  ## create a EnsDb database file from the Gtf
  DbFile <- ensDbFromGRanges(Gtf, organism="Mus_musculus", version=77)
  ## we can either generate a database package, or directly load the data
  Edb <- EnsDb(DbFile)

  ## retrieve the toplevel DNA
  Dna <- ah[["AH22042"]]

  ## we next retrieve the sequence of all exons
  library(Rsamtools)
  exons <- exons(Edb)
  exonSeq <- getSeq(Dna, exons)

#+END_SRC

In the example below we load a =GRanges= containing gene definitions for genes encoded on chromosome Y and generate a EnsDb SQLite database from that information.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## Generate a sqlite database from a GRanges object specifying
  ## genes encoded on chromosome Y
  load(system.file("YGRanges.RData", package="ensembldb"))
  Y

  DB <- ensDbFromGRanges(Y, path=tempdir(), version=75,
                         organism="Homo_sapiens")

  edb <- EnsDb(DB)
  edb

#+END_SRC


Alternatively we can build the annotation database using the =ensDbFromGtf= function, that extracts most of the required data from a GTF file which can be downloaded from Ensembl (e.g. from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens for human gene definitions from Ensembl version 75; for plant genomes etc files can be retrieved from ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org). All information except the chromosome lengths and the NCBI Entrezgene IDs can be extracted from these GTF files. The function also tries to retrieve chromosome length information automatically from Ensembl.

Below we create the annotation from a gtf file that we fetch directly from Ensembl.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :ravel eval=FALSE
  library(ensembldb)

  ## the GTF file can be downloaded from
  ## ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens/
  gtffile <- "Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz"
  ## generate the SQLite database file
  DB <- ensDbFromGtf(gtf=gtffile, verbose=TRUE)

  ## load the DB file directly
  EDB <- EnsDb(DB)

  ## alternatively, build the annotation package
  ## and finally we can generate the package
  makeEnsembldbPackage(ensdb=DB, version="0.99.12",
                       maintainer="Johannes Rainer <johannes.rainer@eurac.edu>",
                       author="J Rainer")
