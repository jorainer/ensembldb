Description: The package provides functions to create and use
        transcript centric annotation databases/packages. The
        annotation for the databases are directly fetched from Ensembl
        using their Perl API. The functionality and data is similar to
        that of the TxDb packages from the GenomicFeatures package,
        but, in addition to retrieve all gene/transcript models and
        annotations from the database, the ensembldb package provides
        also a filter framework allowing to retrieve annotations for
        specific entries like genes encoded on a chromosome region or
        transcript models of lincRNA genes.
